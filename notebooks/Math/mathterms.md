# Meta Terms of Maths

## Principle

## Axiom

## Lemma

## Conjecture

## Theorem

## Corollary

## Proof
  ## BASIC
  ### Proof by Contradiction.
  ### Proof by Induction Reasoning
  ### Proof by Deduction Reasoning / Constuction / Direct.
  
  ## ADVANCED
  ### Launch Pads - Existing Proofs again it is induction but induction of induction like starting from Inception.
  ### Flow Charts - Rigours Proofs with Math Portal usages.
  ### Transdution - Rules of one world applies to another due to their abstract similarity.
  ### The pigeon hole principle (Theory of Computing book)
  ### Non Constructive proof.
  ### Proof by Geometry  - especially for NUMBER THEORY.
  ### Proof by LOGIC & AXIOMS

## Equation - Dancing of automata with Finite States, at least in mathematics they dance for ever.
  ### Roots
  ### Poles
  ### Eigen values - Coefficeint of Roots vectors or Characteristic vectors
  ### Canonical Form - Normal or Standard Form - It is a Conventional form to speak the math language.
  
  #### In Control System dancing of two equation leads to poles & zero - poles or infinities but can be considered as root of one of the equation dancing negating the effects of other dancing.
