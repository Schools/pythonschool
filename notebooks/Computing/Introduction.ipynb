    "Counting is dependent on computation feasbility and physical motions like speed of light.\n",
    "We have limited capacity of computation with speed of light being constant. Even if we do counting at light speed. (unless we make use of dark speed)\n",

    "Hashing can account for available limited computation capacity.\n",
    "Hashing is the only way to count only items which is of our interest or decidability instead of everything.\n",
