    "# Hashing & Hashing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting is dependent on computation feasbility and physical motions like speed of light.\n",
    "We have limited capacity of computation with speed of light being constant. Even if we do counting at light speed. (unless we make use of dark speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing can account for available limited computation capacity.\n",
    "Hashing is the only way to count only items which is of our interest or decidability instead of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing mostly makes use of \"Pigeon Hole Principles\" & \"Extended Pigeon Hole Principle\" for categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is highly dependent on NUMBER THEORY.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo Arithmetic is a kind of Hashing function which categorizes based on Reminder.\n",

    "Associative arrays: Hash tables are commonly used to implement many types of in-memory tables. They are used to implement associative arrays (arrays whose indices are arbitrary strings or other complicated objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Database indexing: Hash tables may also be used as disk-based data structures and database indices (such as in dbm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Caches: Hash tables can be used to implement caches i.e. auxiliary data tables that are used to speed up the access to data, which is \n",
    "primarily stored in slower media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object representation: Several dynamic languages, such as Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby use hash tables to implement objects.\n",
    "Hash Functions are used in various algorithms to make their computing faster\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Suited places\n",
    "1. Sorting where ORDINAL ordering is required.\n",
    "2. Multidimensional data\n",
    "3. Prefix searching\n",
    "4. dynamic data and no unique keys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways of generation of Hash\n",
    "a. Static\n",
    "b. Dynamic (size of table can grow, hash function should handle it)\n",
    "Load factor is important measure over here\n",

    "Important key aspect which we cannot ignore on Hash Function.\n",
    "1. It should not consume much time and space.\n",
    "2. Pigeon hole principle\n",
    "3. Data distribution can be well represented by Hash distribution (based on ordinality) - Conversely if we know a distribution of data we can write a better hash function.\n",
